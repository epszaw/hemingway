# Hemingway ‚úçÔ∏è

## Idea

The core idea of this project is a simplification of e2e and bdd "browser-based" testing with
minimalistic API and zero configuraton.

This points must save time on early development stages and give ability to write tests for everyone
‚Äì you just need know base stories syntax and html-selectors.

We have a lot of tools like Selenium, WebDriver, Nightwatch and other cool projects, but they needs
a lot of knowledge, like basics in programming on specific language or skills in environment setup.

This project will solve these problems üòå

## Usage

At this time we have only one way to install hemingway and use it ‚Äì cli.

### Installation

Install package with you favorite `npm` client:

```
npm i --save-dev hemingway
```

Or:

```
yarn add -D hemingway
```

You can install package globally or directly into your project.

_The heart of hemingway is puppeteer and you must have installed Google Chrome browser. Hemingway
does not working without it_!

### CLI

Hemingway is very minimalistic (yet, huh üòÖ) and has a really few options. Also it can be used
without ones.

`-o, --open` ‚Äì disable headless mode and opens browser for each test.

```
hemingway -o
```

---

`-s, --story <path>` ‚Äì runs specific story.

```
hemingway -s path/to/your/story.md
```

## Stories writing

One of the core ideas ‚Äì simple and declarative syntax. The best example is SQL ‚Äì you can read your
queries like sentenses and understan it.

Hemingway has sql-like syntax. For example:

```md
OPEN "https://google.com"
FIND "#lst-ib" AS "search-input"
TAKE "search-input" TYPE "Hello{Enter}"
WAIT "#rhscol"
FIND ".bkWMgd" HAVE "length" NOT EQUAL "0"
```

Do you understand what we expect here? I think yes üôÇ

### Concepts

Stories have 3 main abstractions ‚Äì operator, argument and modifier.

Operator ‚Äì command in UPPERCASE. It is a way for declare actions.

Argument ‚Äì text between double quotes next for operator. Now, all operators are unary (using one
argument).

Modifier ‚Äì are special operators withous arguments. They must be placed before operator for
modify operator behavior. Now hemingway has only `NOT` modifier and it is the best example for this
abstraction.

### Flow

All stories using "flow". It is a very simple concept ‚Äì do something in one line.

For example we have next story line `FIND ".bkWMgd" HAVE "length" NOT EQUAL "0"`. Operators will be
processed in sequence like flow. Lets look at simple graph:

```
FIND ".bkWMgd" -> (result) -> HAVE "length" -> (result) -> NOT(EQUAL "0")
```

Afrer each step we put result to next operator (like pipe-operator in some languages, in particular
Elixir). It's very simple for understanding and for writing test cases.

Stories also have state and you can use it with special operators like `AS` and `TAKE`, but they
don't affect flow concept. For example we can take this case:

```
FIND "#lst-ib" AS "search-input"
TAKE "search-input" TYPE "Hello{Enter}"
```

And lets disassemble it in familiar to us graph:

```
state {}
FIND "#lst-ib" -> (result) AS "search-input"


state {
  'search-input': <Element>
}
TAKE "search-input" -> (result from state) -> TYPE "Hello{Enter}"
```

Each story has its-own state and stories have not access to other story state.

### Operators list

| Operator name | Arguments  | Description                                                                                                                         | Alias |

| `FIND`        | `selector` | Find element by given selector. Similar to `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll` bahavior. If found              |       |
| `AS`          | `alias`    | Save result of previous operator to story state with given alias                                                                    |       |
| `TAKE`        | `alias`    | Takes something from story state by given alias                                                                                     |       |
| `TYPE`        | `text`     | Types text into input and input-like elements. Also supports keyboard keys like `Hello world{Enter}`.                               |       |
| `WAIT`        | `selector` | Waits given selector in default for puppeteer timeout (will be configurable in the future)                                          |       |
| `EQUAL`       | `value`    | Compare result of previous operator with given value                                                                                |       |
| `HAVE`        | `property` | Takes property from result of previous operator. For example `FIND ".element" HAVE "length"` will return count of `.element` nodes. |       |
| `SLEEP`       | `time`     | Waits given time (in miliseconds).                                                                                                  |       |
| `CLICK`       |            | Triggers click event on element from result of previous operator.                                                                   |       |

| `NOT`         | Boolean negative for next operator result. Best example is `EQUAL`. |
